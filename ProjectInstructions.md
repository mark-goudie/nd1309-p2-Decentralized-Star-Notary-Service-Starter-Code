## Project 5 Instructions

# Task 1

Your Project is to Modify the StarNotary version 2 contract code to achieve the following:

Add a name and a symbol for your starNotary tokens. Resource [Complete]
Add a function lookUptokenIdToStarInfo, that looks up the stars using the Token ID, and then returns the name of the star. [Complete] - StarNotary.sol
Add a function called exchangeStars, so 2 users can exchange their star tokens...Do not worry about the price, just write code to exchange stars between users. [Complete] - StarNotary.sol
Write a function to Transfer a Star. The function should transfer a star from the address of the caller. The function should accept 2 arguments, the address to transfer the star to, and the token ID of the star. [Complete] - StarNotary.sol

# Task 2

Add supporting unit tests, to test the following:
The token name and token symbol are added properly. [Complete] - TestStarNotary.js
2 users can exchange their stars. [Complete] - TestStarNotary.js
Stars Tokens can be transferred from one address to another. [Complete] - TestStarNotary.js

# Task 3

Deploy your Contract to Public Testnet
Edit the truffle.config file to add settings to deploy your contract to the Goerli or Sepolia Public Network. [Complete] - truffle-config.js rinkeby network

# Helper Points:

Command used to deploy to Rinkeby truffle migrate --reset --network rinkeby [Complete] - Goerli: truffle migrate --network goerli --reset
You will need to have your Metamask’s seed and Infura setup.
This was shown to you in detail in the lesson on Solidity, while creating ERC-20 tokens on Rinkeby.

# Task 4

Modify the front end of the DAPP to achieve the following:
Lookup a star by ID using tokenIdToStarInfo() (you will have to add code for this in your index.html and index.js files) [Complete]

# Project Submission Instructions:
